3. How to use **material-ui** in your React App.

### Important Note.
> I have used a free API from https://newsapi.org/. I will not upload the config file having the key that I have used, but you could register in their website and use it for free.
> *Therefore unless you register and get a key, this app will not work for you.*
> The `config.js` file is kept in the root folder and is imported by the `Schema.js`
